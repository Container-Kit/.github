ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to ContainerKit!
We're all about making Mac container management awesome.

We create simple, powerful tools and beautiful UIs that make handling OCI containers super easyâ€”especially if you're using Apple's cool, native tech like the Apple Container CLI. We've got you covered!

ðŸš€ What We're All About
Simply put, our main job is to cut out the complexity!

We're here to turn those tricky Linux containers (running as tiny, lightweight VMs on your Apple Silicon Macâ€”M1, M2, M3, etc.) into a smooth, native experience. We want to give developers and DevOps folks beautiful, high-performing apps that just work.

P.S. We're part of the team at Ethercorps!
